<dd><p><b>RQ:</b> <i>Do early-life transfers from the parent to the child influence the location decision of the child and, hence, the potential caregiving at older ages?</i></p></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>We study the impact of parental transfers to their children in early life on the child's support to the parents at older ages either in time or with money. 
We conjecture that the type of transfer from the parents has an impact on what kind of help they receive from their children. Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS)
we find that transfers in children's education are associated with higher financial help at older ages. In contrast, transfers to support the children's marriage are positively linked with time support,
such as more visits, from children to their parents. The children's residential decisions are identified as an important mechanism: transfers into education tend to let children move further away whereas
marital transfers are associated with children staying closer to one's parents.</i></p></dd>

<dd><p><b>RQ:</b> <i>Does having more children, potentially as old-age security, save elder parents from &ldquo;working until you drop&rdquo;?</i></p></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>This study provides empirical evidence of the causal impact of fertility outcomes on old-age labor supply, by employing Chinese population policies in the early 1970s and the sex of the 
eldest child within families as fertility instruments. The results show a strong impact of having children on preventing old parents from strenuous works at senior age. Having one more child (son) significantly
reduces post-retirement aged rural parents&rsquo; probability of working by 17.7 (19.8) percentage points. Such impact is especially strong among the more vulnerable elder parents with worse health and little pension 
benefits. Furthermore, the results suggest that population policies that aim at reducing fertility might jeopardize elderly well being by compelling old parents in bad health to continue working.</i></p></dd>

<p>3. <b>Ziwei Rao</b>, &ldquo;Trapped by Good Years &ndash; The Economic Impact of Weather Shocks&rdquo;.</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd><p><b>RQ:</b> <i>How do rural families fare economically under weather risks with migration responses? Is good weather necessarily a good thing for the total household income?</i></p></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>This paper investigates the effect of weather shocks on income among Chinese rural households 
and emphasizes the role of families&rsquo; migration responses. I use household panel data from National Fixed Point 
survey merged with meteorological weather information at the village level. Results from a fixed effects model 
show a negative link between household total income and precipitation. Studying income diversification, I find 
a greater drop in migration income that surpasses the gains from farming following good years with more water. 
Labor allocation analysis further supports the potential explanation and shows that labor is reallocated from 
migration to agricultural work in good weather. Good years may trap rural residents in low-paying agricultural 
work and lead to an overall worse outcome for the family. My findings highlight a novel negative aspect of good 
weather shocks and suggest facilitation of migration to improve the wellbeing of rural households under climate 
change.</i> </p></dd>
