<p>1. <b>Ziwei Rao</b>, Max Groneck, Rob Alessie, &ldquo;Should I Stay or Should I Go? Intergenerational Transfers and Residential Choice: Evidence from China&rdquo;, submitted. [<a href="RaoGroneckAlessie_20Jan21.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>PDF</a>]</p>

<dd><p><b>RQ:</b> <i>Do early-life transfers from the parent to the child influence the location decision of the child and, hence, the potential caregiving at older ages?</i></p></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>We study the impact of parental transfers to their children in early life on the child's support to the parents at older ages either in time or with money. 
We conjecture that the type of transfer from the parents has an impact on what kind of help they receive from their children. Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS)
we find that transfers in children's education are associated with higher financial help at older ages. In contrast, transfers to support the children's marriage are positively linked with time support,
such as more visits, from children to their parents. The children's residential decisions are identified as an important mechanism: transfers into education tend to let children move further away whereas
marital transfers are associated with children staying closer to one's parents.</i></p></dd>

<p>2. <b>Ziwei Rao</b>, &ldquo;Children or Work? The Impact of Fertility on Old-age Labour Supply&rdquo;.</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd><p><b>RQ:</b> <i>Does having more children, potentially as old-age security, save elder parents from &ldquo;working until you drop&rdquo;?</i></p></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>This study provides the first empirical evidence of the causal impact of fertility outcomes on old-age labor supply, by employing population policies in the early 1970s and the sex of the eldest
child within families as plausibly exogenous instruments of fertility. The results show strong impact of children on preventing old parents from strenuous works at senior age, e.g. having one more child
significantly reduces post-retirement aged rural parents&rsquo; probability of working by 12.8 percentage points. Such impact is especially strong among the more vulnerable elder parents with worse health and
little pension benefits. Furthermore, the results suggest that population policies might jeopardize the elderly well being by reducing family sizes and compelling old parents in bad health to continue working.</i></p></dd>
